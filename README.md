This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving type errors.  The `bug.js` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a fix.  TypeErrors often arise from mismatched data types passed to functions or components, frequently related to asynchronous data fetching or prop handling. This example highlights how to identify and resolve these issues using careful type checking and data transformation techniques.
